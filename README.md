CTF at : https://crypta.sfpn.net/

This CTF challenge was mandatory as a part of the andvanced cryptography course of my master.

I wrote most of the code except in the plugins folder : most of the code was already given. For example, I only produced classes extending the Plugin class myself (and added a few other lines in other functions...)
