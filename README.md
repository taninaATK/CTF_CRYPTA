CTF at : https://crypta.sfpn.net/

This CTF challenge was mandatory as a part of the advanced cryptography course of my master (2nd year).

About the 'plugins' folder : most of the code was already given, we were expected to add classes to the files. For example, in the 'telnet_client.py' file, I only produced classes extending the Plugin class myself (and added a few other lines in other functions...)
