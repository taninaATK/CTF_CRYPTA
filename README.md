CTF at : https://crypta.sfpn.net/

This CTF challenge was mandatory as a part of the andvanced cryptography course of my master.

I wrote most of the code except in the plugins folder : most of the code was already given. For example, in the telnet_client.py file, most of the code was already given. However I wrote all the classes extending the Plugin class myself.
